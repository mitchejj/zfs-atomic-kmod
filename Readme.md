# zfs-atomic-kmod
TODO: Add build badge

## What is this?
This a redo of my previous ostree-zfs-kmods, this is a derivation is a downstream distillation of ublue-os/akmods

The `zfs-atomic-kmod-build` workflow is set to run daily at 7:00 UTC, attempting to ensure a new build is produced after the latest and previous stable images of `quay.io/fedora/fedora-minimal` have been published.

## Features
Nothing special just `zfs-2.3.x`. The main goal is to provide an easy way
reproduce this repo and build the zfs modules. 

### NOTE: the ZFS kmods are not yet signed to enable secure boot
### NOTE: that the `*.tar.gz` source files are not cryptographically verified, which may pose a security risk due to the lack of integrity and authenticity checks.


## Usage
### NOTE: Due to the kernel's tendency to occasionally 'break' ZFS compatibility, it may take several days or weeks for a compatible ZFS version to be released.

Basic example:

    Coming soon
